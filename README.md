# Trained-Snake

- I created the project using `pygame` and Reinforcement learning.
- Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that enables an agent to learn in an environment by trial and error using feedback from its own actions and experiences.
- First I created the classic Snake Game using Python and Pygame. Then I created and train a neural network using PyTorch that can play the game better than most humans.
