# Trained Snake üêç

- I created the project using `pygame` and Reinforcement learning.
- Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that enables an agent to learn in an environment by trial and error using feedback from its own actions and experiences.
- First I created the classic Snake Game using Python and Pygame. Then I created and train a neural network using PyTorch that can play the game better than most humans.
- Deep Q Learning is used to train the model, QNet and QTrainer is used to train the model though the use of Pytorch.
### Initial setup of the project


### Intermediate State of the Training
